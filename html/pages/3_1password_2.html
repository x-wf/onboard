        1Password holds multiple vaults, and each vault contains multiple items, such as passwords, files, tokens, etc. <br><br>
        Everyone with access to a vault can view, print, and copy the items in it. When you first share a vault with someone, they can also create, edit, and delete the items in it.<br><br>
        Every team has access to specific vaults, and when you delete a shared vault, it will also be removed from the devices of everyone you were sharing it with.
